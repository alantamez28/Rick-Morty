## ✍🏻 Description
This app was built in SPA course in Platzi. In addition to what was seen in the course, I implemented all the CSS with Tailwind. It was a challenge for me to implement this framework in webpack. It was satisfying to get this result.

You can see the result here → [Rick & Morty - Characters](http://alejandra-camacho.me/Rick-Morty/)

```
$ npm install

```
